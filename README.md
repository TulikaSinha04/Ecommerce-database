# Ecommerce-database
SQL Data Analysis Project using MySQL Workbench on an E-commerce Dataset. Includes queries for filtering, grouping, joins, subqueries, aggregates, views, and performance optimization with indexes. Deliverables: sql file with queries + screenshots of outputs.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates **SQL-based data analysis** using an **E-commerce dataset**.  
The dataset was originally in Excel with multiple sheets (`customers`, `categories`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `payments`, `shipments`) which were converted into CSVs and loaded into MySQL Workbench as tables.

The goal is to practice and showcase **SQL skills** including:
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- `JOIN` operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
- Views for analysis
- Query optimization using indexes

I have uploaded the PDF with all the details and steps, along with the excel file used
.
